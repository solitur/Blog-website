    <h2 style=font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;>No one — absolutely no one — will tell you starting your own company is
        easy. Entrepreneurship has plenty of challenges for those who choose to embark on it.

        And most entrepreneurs learn the hard way: from their mistakes. While there’s nothing wrong with that method
        (failure is a great teacher), you want to save it for the big lessons.
        Other lessons, such as managing the books and leading your team, can be taught just as effectively in the
        classroom.

        To help you cut down on your learning curve as much as possible, here are the top free (or very inexpensive)
        courses online for running a startup, organized from introductory to advanced.</h2>

        lot more doable.

        If you’re actively pursuing a startup, you’re eligible to sign up. Everyone (whether or not they participate in
        the program) will have access to online lectures and office hours, but participants will also get a peer group.
        This group is run by a Y Combinator alumni who provides weekly 1:1 consulting over video and email.

        The 10 lectures feature famous members of the startup world, like Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield, Box CEO Aaron
        Levie, and Facebook VP of Growth Alex Schultz.</p>
